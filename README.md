# Giving Duo
Browser extension for giving more than one lingot on Duolingo.

NOTE: Lingots seem to be being deprecated on Dulingo so sending takes a ridiculously long time. This plugin will not be developed further developed officially (pull request still open) until a clear decision is made by Duolingo.
